# Readsidian Plugin

This is a small plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) to automatically create notes for the books in your Goodreads (https://www.goodreads.com) shelves.

The plugin creates a note for all the books in the shelf specified in the settings. It uses nunjucks template system (refer to the example template.)
