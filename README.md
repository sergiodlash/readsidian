# Readsidian Plugin

This is a small plugin for Obsidian (https://obsidian.md) to automatically create notes for the books in your Goodreads (https://www.goodreads.com) shelves.


**This plugin it is in very early stages of development!**

Eventhough this is intended to be a simple plugin and thus very unlikely to be dangerous to your data, **this plugin is intended for personal use. Use it in your vault at your own risk!**

Reach out for feature requests and to help develop this idea!
